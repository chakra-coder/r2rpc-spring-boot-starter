# R2RPC Spring Boot Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mostroverkhov/r2rpc-spring-boot-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mostroverkhov/r2rpc-spring-boot-starter)

Spring Boot 2 starter for [R2RPC](https://github.com/mostroverkhov/r2) - [RSocket](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket) based RPC framework with pluggable serialization.

Simplifies creation of `R2RPC` Clients and Servers by providing:

### Server

* sensible auto-configuration (simple `ServerRSocketFactory`, `JSON` serialization and `TCP` transport)
* declarative definition of server endpoints (YAML is preferred)  

```yaml
r2rpc:
 server:
  responder:
    defaults:
      codecs: [jackson-json]
      transport: tcp
    endpoints:
      - name: foo
        port: 8083
        api: [bar, baz]
```
Custom transports can be provided as implementations of `R2ServerTransport`, annotated with `@Name(value)`. Custom codecs - with `2DataCodec` implementations, also annotated with `@Name`.

`api` is set of API interfaces annotated with `R2Api(name)`, each aggregates [R2RPC](https://github.com/mostroverkhov/r2) service definitions. Its implementation serves as Endpoint handler, and must be provided to Spring with 
`ResponderApiProvider` bean for each API implementation.   

API definitions allow to group related R2RPC services in one namespace so they can be shared more conveniently.

Single API definition, referred in configuration as `api:[example]`, can be as follows

```java
@R2Api("example")
public interface ExampleApi {

  BazContract bazContract();
  
  BarContract barContract();
}
```
`BazContract` and `BarContract` are R2RPC service definitions, e.g.

```java
@Service("baz")
public interface BazContract {

  @RequestStream("bazStream")
  Flux<Baz> baz(Baz baz);
}
```

API definition is exposed to Spring with `ServerApiProvider<ExampleApiImpl>` implementation,
where `ExampleApiImpl` is implementation of `ExampleApi` providing handlers for incoming 
requests.
```java
public class ExampleApiProvider implements ResponderApiProvider<ExampleApiImpl> {

  @Override
  public ExampleApiImpl apply(ConnectionContext connectionContext) {
    return new BarApiImpl();
  }
}
```
API definitions are constrained by following rules
* All definitions must have unique names. If several implementations of same API are necessary, 
override name on implementation itself by annotating It with `@R2API(newName)`
* API implementation (handler) must implement at most 1 (one) API definition
* API implementations per endpoint must contribute API definitions of unique type 
  (in other words, no more than one implementation of particular API per endpoint)

Endpoints lifecycle is available with `ServerControls.endpoint(name)` API, which allows to listen for 
endpoint Start and Stop events (success or error), e.g.

```java
            Mono<Endpoint> endpointStart = serverControls
                .endpoint("foo")
                .started()
```  
### Client

* sensible auto-configuration (simple `ClientRSocketFactory`, `JSON` serialization and `TCP` transport)
* declarative definition of Client Connectors

```yaml 
r2rpc:
 client:
  requester:
    defaults:
      codecs: [jackson-json]
      transport: tcp
    endpoints:
      - name: foo
        api: [bar, baz]
```

For each endpoint auto-configuration creates `R2ClientConnector`, which connects to peer with `connect(address,port)`, returns `ApiRequesterFactory`. `ApiRequesterFactory.create(API.class)` returns implementation (dyn proxy) of API interface.
Individual Connectors are obtained with `ClientConnectors.name(endpoint-name)`. APIs are registered by providing bean `RequesterApiProvider<ApiToken>`, where `APiToken` - any class, its package is scanned by auto-configuration for APIs (`@R2API` annotated interfaces)

### Examples

Example module contains simple self-contained runnable application - `R2rpcStarterExampleApplicaton`.
